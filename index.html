<a id="welcome-to-github-pages" class="anchor" href="#welcome-to-github-pages" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Introduction</h3>

<p>Welcome! For our final project, we attempt to use machine learning algorithms to predict the trends of the stock market, specificallly the S&P500 index.</p>

<h3>
<a id="designer-templates" class="anchor" href="#designer-templates" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Our Motivation</h3>

If the stock market was predictable, then wouldn't everybody be making money??? Yes, that's why there have been countless attempts made to find some patterns in it from complicated mathematical models to sentiment analysis of tweets. 
But unfortunately, none have succeeded so far, and the ones that have succeeded would probably keep it a secret. 

Due to the large volume of information generated by the stock market everyday, we have a lot of data to work with. This is perfect for training machine learning algorithms and testing our classifiers since we will not run out of
data to work with.

<a id="creating-pages-manually" class="anchor" href="#creating-pages-manually" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Our Data</h3>

We pulled data from Bloomberg, the Federal Reserve Bank, Yahoo Finance and Quandl. Fortunately, the data we looked for were freely available and easy to access. We looked at data related to the S&P500 index such as the pricing
of its options, its volatility index, and the stocks closely related to it. We also looked at data that have been known to affect the movement of the S&P500 index such as the consumer price index (CPI), M2 (a measure of money supply),
real GDP (gross domestic product), and the yields of treasury bonds.

<a id="authors-and-contributors" class="anchor" href="#authors-and-contributors" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Our Methods</h3>

The machine learning algorithms we used are from the sklearn package in Python.
