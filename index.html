<p>Welcome! For our final project, we attempt to use machine learning algorithms to predict the trends of the stock market, specificallly the S&P500 index. Our goal is to predict whether the index will go up or down by the end
of a particular week. So essentially we are faced with a binary classification problem. Our baseline, or the worst we can achieve is a 50% accuracy through randomly guessing up or down. We want to improve on that by choosing appropriate
data to train our classifiers on. </p>

<a id="designer-templates" class="anchor" href="#designer-templates" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Our Motivation</h3>

If the stock market was predictable, then wouldn't everybody be making money??? Yes, that's why there have been countless attempts made to find some patterns in it from complicated mathematical models to sentiment analysis of tweets. 
But unfortunately, none have succeeded so far, and the ones that have succeeded would probably keep it a secret. 

Due to the large volume of information generated by the stock market everyday, we have a lot of data to work with. This is perfect for training machine learning algorithms and testing our classifiers since we will not run out of
data to work with.

<img src="images/yahoo.png" alt="yahoo" width="200" height="200"/>

<p>We pulled data from Bloomberg, the Federal Reserve Bank, Yahoo Finance and Quandl. Fortunately, the data we looked for were freely available and easy to access. We looked at data related to the S&P500 index such as the pricing
of its options, its volatility index, and the stocks closely related to it. We also looked at data that have been known to affect the movement of the S&P500 index such as the consumer price index (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer_price_index">CPI</a>), <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Money_supply">M2</a> (a measure of money supply),
real <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gross_domestic_product">GDP</a> (gross domestic product), and the yields of treasury bonds. In addition, we looked at the stock indices of global markets such as Germany, Hong Kong, Paris etc. 
Our rationale for this is that because of globalization, markets nowadays are rarely isolated. For example, the fall of Lehman Brothers affected stock markets all over the world. Similarly, an important event in Germany or Hong Kong could
affect the market in the US. Thus we take the representative stock indices of these global markets into account as well.</p>

<a id="authors-and-contributors" class="anchor" href="#authors-and-contributors" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Our Results</h3>
The first method we used is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_forest">Random Forest Classification</a> and the data is simply the attributes of the S&P500 index itself. We wanted to see if just by looking at simple attributes such as the opening/closing price and high/low of each day, we
could improve on our baseline model. As expected, our accuracy was around 50%, so no improvement.

Next, we l
